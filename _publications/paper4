title: "To What Degree Does Rapid Guessing Distort
Aggregated Test Scores? A Meta-analytic
Investigation"
collection: publications
permalink: /files/Paper4.pdf?raw=true
excerpt: 'The present meta-analysis sought to quantify the average degree of aggregated test score distortion due to rapid guessing (RG). Included studies
group-administered a low-stakes cognitive assessment, identified RG via
response times, and reported the rate of examinees engaging in RG, the
percentage of RG responses observed, and/or the degree of score distortion
in aggregated test scores due to RG. The final sample consisted of 25 studies
and 39 independent samples comprised of 443,264 unique examinees.
Results demonstrated that an average of 28.3% of examinees engaged in
RG (21% were deemed to engage in RG on a nonnegligible number of items)
and 6.89% of item responses were classified as rapid guesses. Across 100
effect sizes, RG was found to negatively distort aggregated test scores by an
average of 0.13 standard deviations; however, this relationship was moderated by both test content area and filtering procedure.'
