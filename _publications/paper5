excerpt: 'For institutions where English is the primary language of instruction, English assessments for
admissions such as the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and International English
Language Testing System (IELTS) give admissions decision-makers a sense of a studentâ€™s skills
in academic English. Despite this explicit purpose, these exams have also been used for the
practice of predicting academic success. In this study, we meta-analytically synthesized 132 effect
sizes from 32 studies containing validity evidence of academic English assessments to determine
whether different assessments (a) predicted academic success (as measured by grade point
average [GPA]) and (b) did so comparably. Overall, assessments had a weak positive correlation
with academic achievement (<i>r</i>=.231, <i>p</i> <.001). Additionally, no significant differences were
found in the predictive power of the IELTS and TOEFL exams. No moderators were significant,
indicating that these findings held true across school type, school level, and publication type.
Although significant, the overall correlation was low; thus, practitioners are cautioned from using
standardized English-language proficiency test scores in isolation in lieu of a holistic application
review during the admissions process.'
