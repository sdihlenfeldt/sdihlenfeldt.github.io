excerpt: 'This study sought to investigate how states communicate results for academic
achievement and English language proficiency (ELP) assessments to parents who are English
learners (EL). This objective was addressed by evaluating: (a) whether score reports and
interpretive guides for state academic achievement and ELP assessments in each state were
translated for EL parents; and (b) if so, whether recommended score reporting guidelines were
followed in practice. Results demonstrated that for state achievement tests, 29 states had
translated score reports and 28 had translated interpretive guides. Nearly every state translated
these materials for their ELP assessments in a wide variety of languages. Across ELP and state
achievement assessments, most states were found to limit statistical jargon, utilize
figures/graphics to communicate test results, and include follow-up information for parents, which
represent improvements observed in prior reviews. However, states rarely provided personalization,
statements on intended score use, a studentâ€™s score history, or a direct link to their interpretive
guide in their score reports. Recommendations on making score reports and interpretive guides
more accessible and interpretable for EL parents are discussed'
