Noneffortful rapid guessing (RG) on multistage assessment undermines the validity of inferences made from ability
estimates. Multiple response patterns were simulated for simulees of varying ability to explore estimation accuracy
based on the location of RG. An effort-moderated IRT model is explored as a potential solution. Implications are
discussed
