This study explores the relationship between feedback presentation, emotional affect, and
feedback uptake. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three feedback conditions after
taking a GRE practice test. Results indicate that both affect (positive and negative) and feedback
condition are significantly associated with reported likelihood to change studying behaviors.
