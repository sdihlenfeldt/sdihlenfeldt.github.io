Welcome to my website! My name is Sam Ihlenfeldt (or Samuel D. Ihlenfeldt on publications) and I am just starting my sixth year in the Quantitative Methods in Education Ph.D. program at the University of Minnesota. My driving belief is that testing can be used for good, but only if it is fair for every stakeholder, including students and parents from all backgrounds. With the support of my advisors, Dr. Joseph Rios and Dr. Michael Rodriguez, I have had the opportunity to apply this belief as an educator, a consultant, and a resercher for both private and public organizations. 

Part of the process of fair assessment is communicating test results. If the results of a test (and their intended uses and interpretations) are not communicated properly, any other efforts to validate those uses and interpretations are undermined. For my dissertation, titled "Creating Score Reports for Parents who cannot Communicate Fluently in English", I will be using funds from the NCME Mission Fund Grant to conduct experiemental research with parents who speak English, Hmong, Spanish, and Somali. It is my hope that principles of test accommodation literature can be applied to generate score reports that better communicate the intended uses (and limitations) of large-scale standardized tests.
