Welcome to my website! My name is Sam Ihlenfeldt (or Samuel D. Ihlenfeldt on publications) and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Quantitative Methods in Education program at the University of Minnesota. I will be defending my dissertation in August of 2025. My driving belief is that testing can be used for good, but only if it is fair for every stakeholder, including students and parents from all backgrounds. With the support of my advisor, Dr. Michael Rodriguez, I have had the opportunity to apply this belief as an educator, a consultant, and a researcher for both private and public organizations. 

Part of the process of fair assessment is communicating test results. If the results of a test (and their intended uses and interpretations) are not communicated properly, any other efforts to validate those uses and interpretations are undermined. For my dissertation, "Do Not Put Red With Our Children: A Thematic Analysis of Somali Perspectives on Score Reporting For State Assessments", I conducted focus groups with Somali parents to understand how they accessed and reported understanding student reports on state summative assessments. It is my hope that the perspectives of parents can be leveraged to improve score reporting practices. My research was supported by the NCME Mission Fund.
