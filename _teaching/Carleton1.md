A description of the course from the Carleton College website:

<blockquote> Introduction to statistics and data analysis. Practical aspects of statistics, including extensive use of statistical software, interpretation and communication of results, will be emphasized. Topics include: exploratory data analysis, correlation and linear regression, design of experiments, basic probability, the normal distribution, randomization approach to inference, sampling distributions, estimation, hypothesis testing, and two-way tables.</blockquote>

For this course, I structured the curriculum, designed activities, wrote and graded tests, and held regular office hours.
