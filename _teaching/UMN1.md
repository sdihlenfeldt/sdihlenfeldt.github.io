<h4>Course description</h4>
A description of the course from the University of Minnesota website:

EPSY 3264 is an undergraduate introduction to statistics and is not a substitute for an AP Statistics course. It can be taught over an entire high school semester or academic year.

EPSY 3264 is designed to engage students using a modeling and simulation approach to inference. Statistics is more than just an application of mathematics or a methodology used in some other discipline. Statistics is a principled way of thinking about the world. In particular, it is a principled approach to data collection, prediction, and scientific inference. In today’s dynamic and interdisciplinary world, success in confronting new analytical issues requires both substantial knowledge of a scientific or technological area and highly flexible problem-solving strategies.

This course uses pedagogical principles that are founded in research, such as daily small group activities and discussion. Upon completion of this course, students should have an understanding of the foundational concepts of data, variation, and inference, as well as an appreciation for the fundamental role that statistics plays in a host of disciplines, such as business, economics, law, and medicine.

This is not a class where students come to class each day, listen, watch, and take notes! The primary method for learning new statistical concepts and methods is by students reading the provided materials before class, participating in class activities and discussions, and working through homework assignments.

This course makes extensive use of small and large group activities and discussions to introduce ideas and content, as well as to deepen students’ understanding of material encountered in the readings. Students’ learning experience is thus dependent, to some extent, on their classmates and vice versa. Because of this, it is essential that students not only attend class each day and participate in the activities and discussions, but that they show up prepared, having completed the homework and readings assigned.

Internalizing a discipline's way of thinking about and solving problems is a time-consuming process, with the keyword being “process.” It is not something that can be taught to students in a semester or even a year-long course. Learning statistics takes much more than memorizing formulae or software commands. It requires active participation and questioning both in and out of the classroom. There are many opportunities to learn the material through class activities, readings, and homework assignments, but in the end, students will have to do all of the hard work of actually learning that material.
